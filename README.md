# AA Sharp

## Challenge Statement Addressed 🎯
*  Can we as a company, improve clarity with customer luggage when boarding a plane?

## Project Description 🤯

Introducing our innovative project, AASharp, aimed at revolutionizing the passenger experience in air travel. With our user-friendly mobile app, travelers can now enjoy unprecedented clarity and satisfaction when it comes to their carry-on and checked baggage. Leveraging predictive models specific to A321 and 737 aircraft, our app factors in variables like the number of checked and carry-on bags, weather, destination, travel type, day of the week, holidays, aircraft type etc to deliver accurate predictions. The predictions are personalized to each passenger and allows them to know their chances of having to check a bag at the gate well before the boarding process begins. This real-time solution empowers passengers, reducing uncertainty and stress, ultimately offering a smoother, more informed journey. Our commitment to enhancing the travel experience sets new standards for clarity and satisfaction in air travel.


## Project Value 💰

This application’s impact is multi-faceted and best part is everyone wins!

1. Improved Customer Experience:
* This application allows for improved customer experience by allowing travelers to experience less stress and more satisfaction while ultimately building loyalty towards the airline

2. Enhanced Employee Experience:

* AASharp also enhances employee experiences by providing data that helps to minimize last minute complications creating a more efficient and harmonious work environment.

3. Company Advancement/Revenue Boost: 

* The application positions American airlines as innovators in the industry, setting the standards for clarity and satisfaction in air travel. Leading to a boost in revenue with a seamless boarding process and increased checked baggage fees as passengers are better prepared to check their bags, preventing last-minute disruptions.


With AASharp we understand that carry-on luggage is not just luggage, it's a vessel for memories that needs the clarity and precision that our application will ensure.
